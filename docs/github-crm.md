# GitHub CRM

How I use Github as my CRM.

Notice: This is a living document, starting out with my basic steps and will break it down more and supply tools as I go along.

## Geting started

First I created an [`organization`](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) for my company in Github. This is the organization I will use for my team and any of my client's repo's will live here.

Install the following Github plugins and actions
- [weekly-digest](https://github.com/apps/weekly-digest)

## Clients & Projects

For each client a monorepo is created which contains all the different Projects associated with it. Also for ease to the client an e-mail is created that auto creates tickets for each client.
